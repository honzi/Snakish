-----------

A different take on the classic game of Snake. Instead of a tail that grows in size, obstacles appear in the world around you that restrict your movement options and create a maze-like environment. There are many settings available for customizing your game experience, including wrapping, number of obstacles created at the start and per point, frame and point limits, and keyboard controls. Settings are saved in localStorage.
